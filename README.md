# Ios Card Game

You have created a game using Xcode and Swift that incorporates various layout elements and modifiers. These include container views, horizontal and vertical stack views, and modifiers. Container views are useful for organizing and grouping related user interface elements, while horizontal and vertical stack views are used to arrange views in a row or column, respectively. Modifiers can be used to modify the appearance or behavior of views. Overall, your use of these layout elements and modifiers has provided a solid foundation for your game's user interface.
