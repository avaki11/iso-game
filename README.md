# Ios Card Game

I have created a game using Xcode and Swift that incorporates various layout elements and modifiers. These include container views, horizontal and vertical stack views, and modifiers. Container views are useful for organizing and grouping related user interface elements, while horizontal and vertical stack views are used to arrange views in a row or column, respectively. I used modifiers to modify the appearance or behavior of views. Overall, I have been able to use this layout elements and modifiers to provide a solid foundation for my game's user interface.
